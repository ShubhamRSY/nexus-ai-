# Nexus

**Purpose-built AI agents. One CX platform. (Open-source)**  
Nexus is an omnichannel AI agent platform for customer experience teams — one orchestrator for **Chat**, **Copilot**, and **Voice**, grounded with **RAG**, protected by **JWT auth + guardrails**, and built for **operations** (streaming, rate limits, logs, backups).

## What Is Nexus?

Customer experience (CX) teams lose time and accuracy when chat, voice, and internal tooling live in separate silos. Nexus solves this with a single AI-powered runtime that can resolve interactions, assist frontline agents, and improve operations — all from one console and one orchestration engine.

**Three channels, one engine:**

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Chat** | Live AI conversation with SSE streaming, WebSocket streaming, RAG citations, full session history |
| **Copilot** | Agent-assist — paste a transcript, get an AI-suggested reply |
| **Voice** | PSTN calls via Twilio, Amazon Connect, or any SIP/CCaaS. Live STT, AI TTS. |

> **No API key required.** Without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Nexus falls back to a mock LLM — the console, voice simulator, smoke tests, and all 109+ unit tests work immediately.

**What we do (and how it transforms CX)**

- **AI Agents for Customers**: resolve customer inquiries end-to-end across chat and voice — from intake and authentication to execution and follow-up.
- **AI Agents for Frontline Teams (Copilot)**: guide interactions in real time with the right context, next-best actions, and draft responses that reduce handle time and errors.
- **AI Agents for Operations**: evaluate interactions, surface insights, and enable continuous improvement (quality + safety) across both human and AI agents.

**AI-driven outcomes**

- **Faster, better resolutions**: always-on support with consistent answers grounded in your knowledge base.
- **Speed + accuracy + consistency**: reduce errors and handle time with copilot assistance and guardrails.
- **Operate CX with full visibility**: health, logs, analytics, and (optional) observability integrations to continuously improve performance.

## Commercial / Hosted Nexus (coming soon)

Nexus is open-source, but a hosted/enterprise offering is planned for teams that want managed operations and advanced CX workflows.

**Licensing**

- **Open-source**: AGPLv3 (`project/LICENSE`)
- **Commercial license**: available for closed-source/proprietary usage — see [`project/COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md`](project/COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md)

**Planned hosted features** (beyond what’s already in the open-source repo)

- **Fully managed operations** (hands-off updates, on-call, SLA)
- **Advanced analytics & QA** (evaluation dashboards, coaching insights, quality scoring)
- **Premium integrations** (CRM/ticketing/telephony connectors) and white-glove onboarding

**Already in open source (pilot-ready)**

- OIDC SSO (Auth0 / Okta / Azure AD / Google Workspace) + JIT user provisioning
- Request metrics, latency tracking, auth-failure counters (`/api/v1/metrics`)
- Daily backups, restore drill, DR runbooks, k6 load-test harness
- SOC 2 readiness checklist and access-control / key-rotation docs

**Branding**

- The **Nexus** name/logo/branding are trademarks. See [`project/TRADEMARKS.md`](project/TRADEMARKS.md).

## Nexus Concepts

Nexus is organized around a small set of primitives so you can reason about the system (and extend it safely) without needing to learn every file at once.

**Core primitives**

- **Orchestrator**: The brain of the runtime. It receives a user event (chat message, copilot transcript, or voice turn), loads session context, retrieves relevant knowledge, selects an agent policy, and streams back tokens.
- **Agents**: Configured behaviors (prompts + tools + routing rules). An agent can be specialized (billing, refunds, troubleshooting) or general-purpose, and can be swapped per request.
- **Channels**: Transport + UX mode. Channel adapters normalize inputs/outputs so the orchestrator sees a consistent event shape while each channel keeps its own streaming protocol and pacing.
  - **Chat**: JSON response or streaming via SSE/WS
  - **Copilot**: transcript → suggested reply (agent-assist)
  - **Voice**: streaming STT → LLM → TTS (telephony provider integration)
- **Knowledge base (RAG)**: A document store + embeddings + retrieval step that grounds responses in your internal docs. Nexus attaches citations so answers can be audited.
- **Guardrails**: Safety and reliability layers around generation: rate limits, auth, tool allowlists, prompt constraints, and (optionally) secrets resolution via Vault.
- **State & storage**: Session history and metadata stored in SQLite (dev) or Postgres (prod), with Redis used for caching and queueing.

**What “Nexus” means in practice**

- **One runtime for all channels**: you do not maintain separate “chat bot” and “voice bot” codepaths with divergent prompt logic.
- **Consistent observability**: streaming, errors, and latency can be traced per session across channels.
- **Safe extension points**: most customization should happen by adding/adjusting agents, tools, and KB content rather than editing request plumbing.

Nexus follows a layered design: channel routers handle chat/copilot/voice inputs, the orchestrator manages session state and prompt construction, and services provide RAG + integrations behind guardrails.

pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/e2e --timeout=60 -v

# Lint + type check
ruff check src/ scripts/
mypy src/
```

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Run tests locally with `pytest tests/`
3. Lint with `ruff check src/ scripts/`
4. Run type check with `mypy src/`
5. Submit a pull request

All contributions — features, bug fixes, docs, tests — are welcome.

---

## Keeping `main` Safe

**Branch protection (recommended)**

- Protect `main` and require PRs (no direct pushes).
- Require status checks to pass (CI / tests / lint / typecheck).
- Require at least 1 review approval.
- Enable “Require branches to be up to date before merging”.

**Secrets hygiene**

- Never commit `.env` files. Use `project/config/environment/.env.example` as the source of truth.
- Treat production credentials as external (Vault, secret manager, or CI secrets) — not repo files.
